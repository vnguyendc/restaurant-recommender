# Restaurant Recommender

## Why?

Indecisive people like me always have huge trouble deciding where to eat. It can take up to several hours for me and my friends to decide where to eat. I would love to know based on my preferences and previous restaurant visits for an app to decide for me where I should eat tonight. Just like a concierge service, I want something/someone to help me decide where I should go out tonight. A smart digital service that can help me make a decision in less than a minute with very few clicks. 

## Our app must:

1. Allow indecisive users make decisions on restaurants easier and more efficient
2. Eliminate the noise that comes with browsing through restaurants to choose from
3. Track what restaurants users enjoyed and visited
4. Allow users to create and store preset preferences to perform searches
5. Provide information of a restaurant one at a time
